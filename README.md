# Movie Predictor Lesson and Code

## A lesson on machine learning and big-data with sample program

This repository hosts a lesson plan (see [lesson folder](lesson/README.md)) and sample Python program (see [code folder](code/README.md)) that uses an SVM algorithm to separate movies into two groups (like vs dislike). The user must first train the model by manipulating the `movies_metadata.csv` file in the data directory. The sample code is designed to be used after introducing concepts via a lecture or other similar lesson.
